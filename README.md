# WP Privacy Toolset

This WordPress plugin is designed to implement the cookie banner and "do not sell" dialog from the wp-calypso project. It is designed to be used on a block theme.

## Use

1.  Add the plugin and activate
2.  Place the "Privacy Tools Consent Banner" block in a template part used on all pagesâ€”i.e. your footer. 
3.  Add the do-not-sell link to the same component as a normal link with the anchor `#do-not-sell-preferences`

## Todo
